# A Computer Scientist's Apology

This book is an argument that computer science acts as a bridge from materialism to ancient, widely held "spirtual" truths which have been considered increasingly unfashionable over the last few centuries.

The closest contemporary scholarly source for these ideas would be Cambridge AI Researcher Joscha Bach.

> "what “spirit” actually means: It’s an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word, but they didn’t have robots that built themselves yet; the only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that a plant is an operating system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then it’s going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics, like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells; it’s a function that tells cells how to behave. And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing, like some morphogenetic field, it is an emergent result of the interactions of each cell with each other cell."

The thesis of this book is that Bach is right about his characterization of the classical notion of a spirit, but he is wrong in his beliefs about the relationship between relevance and meaning. 

This book argues that the space of viable computational strategies for propagating a conceptual structure arbitrary distances through space and time is both extremely narrow, and well within the intersection of the major wisdom traditions of history.

In short, **there are rigorous computational reasons to believe that there is an optimal way of being**, and that the physical universe actively selects against organisms (i.e. individual human beings, cultures, groups, and civiliations) which deviate from this optimal way of being.

These concepts were discovered by numerous independent cultures, and articulated as:

* The wages of sin are death
* The mandate of heaven falls only on kingdoms providing functional, fair governance
* a cyclical process of growth, expansion, and corruption, ending in a violent cataclysm and rebirth

This book argues that there are solid computational reasons to believe these are true features of physical reality, not merely guiding mythologies that happened to work. Given the enormous space of possibly mythologies, the prevalence of particular mythologies throughout time and space can only be interperted as evidence that the mythology reflects some true property of reality. 

A roughly outline of the book is as follows:

* computational processes (i.e. organisms) evolve via selection effects. This describes both biological evolution and the evolution of businesses and software codebases, for similar reasons: they are all concepetual structures that need energy to survive
* hierarchically structured computational processes are better at evolving, and therefore outcompete processes without clear hierarchical structures; this is only true during environmental shifts. In stable environments, hyper-optimzation to the details of the environment should win. This explains both why [Moloch](https://sscpodcast.libsyn.com/meditations-on-moloch) is real and why Moloch doesn't dominate everywhere: Moloch dies when environmental shifts select _against_ overspecialization.
* an operating system for a complex automata that has integrated multiple instrumental subdrives under a single unifying principle will outcompete an operating system without this structure.
* An organism that can temporarily subjugate any specific insrumental drive (i.e., make sacrifices) in the service of its unifying principle will outcompete organisms which cannot because it will be less subject to local fitness maxima. The greedier the algorithm, the more stuck it gets.
* Either the unifying principle has to be context agnostic, or else there will be specific contexts in which the principle cannot effectively operate. Only a physics-transcendant notion of good can operate in all physical contexts and pay attention to arbitrary physical phenomena.
* The only way for a context agnostic operating principle to continuously prescribe context-specific actions which are relevant (i.e. reliably promote local fitness) is for the context-agnonstic priciple to promote the instrumental fitness of nearby actors using that principle.  Love thus works as a strategy both on an indivdual and collective level, which allows its agents to simultaneously keep a context-agonistic principle (thus operating in all contexts) while still reliably acting in a context-specific manner that promotes fitness. Love (i.e. modeling and promoting the fitness of agents near you) is the only strategy that _can_ have this property.
* A context-agnoistic unifying principle has to some relationship with physical reality itself. If reality isn't trusted (i.e, in the absence of hope) the organism will get stuck in local maxima and, due to environmental shifts, die. In a chaotic, (i.e. unpredictable) world, only faith and hope that there is some additional fitness maxima in the future allows the sacrifices necessary to find one and move on to it.
* Universal love, and trust in the goodness reality itself can thus be seen as the optimal strategy for any network of turing-complete agents, because it allows them to transcend arbitrary local fitness maximima (by means of sacrifice), and form networks which are resilient across arbitrary risk categories (by means of love)
* the chaos and unpredictability of the world, even death and decay themselves, have the end result of making love the dominant long term strategy; in a predictable universe without uncertainty and death, we should expect instrumental rationality to lead to a single, totally dominant agent


This outline, and the book, will be evolve over time via a selection process, just lke any other system of concepts or symbols.
