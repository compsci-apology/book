# There computational reasons to believe there is an optimal way of being 
## Belief systems are strategies used by organisms 
### Software systems and belief systems are both encoded strategies. 
1. belief systems tell a person how to act in a given context
2. software systems tell a microprocessor how to act in a given context.
### All organisms and their strategies share traits in common which can be understood with an abstract model. 
1. We can consider all of these a being robots controlled by software.
    1. navigating high dimensional spaces
    2. use sense organs to get information about their environemnt (input)
    3. integrated by concept-networks (processing)
    4. with integration and action controlled by startegies which actuators. (output)
2. This model will allow us to understand the common computational problems that all of these diverse systems have to solve
    1. they must model their environment
    2. they must navigate away from threats
    3. the must navigate towards opportunities.
3. Another advantage of this generic model is that we can remember that these robots always exist in the physical universe.
    1. All robots need to solve the problem of reliably obtaining enough energy to keep themselves alive.
    2. They will always be under selective pressure to be more energetically efficient.
    3. This means they must evaluate _tradeoffs_ because energy spent in one area cannot be spent elsewhere
### Some strategies can themselves evolve 
1. some organisms - those that live in specific, static niches - do not need to change much over time in order to survive.
2. other organisms operate in dynamic niches that change over time, which requires them to evolve their belief systems in order to survive.
3. Evolving a belief system means changing beliefs, i.e. learning and unlearning concepts.
4. It is difficult to get these changes right.
5. Failing to change, or changing in the wrong way, both mean death.
6. **Not all strategies are equally capable of evolving, for computational reasons.**
## Hierarchical structures of increasingly abstract concepts allow for belief systems to safely evolve. 
## Belief systems constitute value claims, and cannot be empirically tested unless they are contextually constrained 
## Abstract beliefs as organizing principles are necessary for group survival. 
## Trust in the organizing principle of the group is necessary for group cohesion 
## The evolutionary limit of "trust in the organizing principle" is trusting reality itself. 
## Trusting reality itself motivates faith, hope, and love as instrumental strategies.
