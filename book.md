# There are computational reasons to believe there is an optimal way of being 
## Belief systems are strategies used by organisms 
### Software systems and belief systems are both encoded strategies. 
1. belief systems tell a person (or group thereof) how to act in a given context
2. software systems tell a microprocessor how to act in a given context.
### All organisms and their strategies share traits in common which can be understood with an abstract model. 
1. We can consider all of these as being robots, with 'bodies' controlled by software.
    1. organisms have bodies, i.e. physical structures with mechanical degrees of freedom
    2. these bodies navigate spaces
        1. the basic 3d space navigated by animals and human beings
        2. but also higher-dimensional spaces of things like absrtract tradeoffs
            1. A business navigates the space of possible markets to participate in
            2. what 'sort of messaging should we send'
            3. where should we invest our capital this year?
            4. what kind of employees should we hire?
    3. organisms sense organs to get information about their environemnt (input)
        1. Sense organs like eyes, ears, etc
        2. Telescopes, microscopes, cameras
        3. Sensor networks, like windmills or social media networks
    4. integrated by concept-networks (processing)
        1. This includes human beings looking at information and making decisions
    5. controlling actuators by constraining their degress of freedom  (output)
        1. Muscles move bones by contracting, i.e. adding tension that reduces degrees of freedom
        2. A thermostat species whether the furance or a/c system should be on or off
        3. A engineering department specifies which priorties they will invest in this quarter
2. This model will allow us to understand the **common computational problems that all of these organisms must solve**
    1. they must model their enviornment and their relationship to it
    2. they must navigate away from threats
    3. the must navigate towards opportunities.
3. Another advantage of this generic model is that we can remember that these robots always exist in the physical universe.
    1. All robots need to solve the problem of reliably obtaining enough energy to keep themselves alive.
    2. They will always be under selective pressure to be more energetically efficient.
    3. This means they must evaluate _tradeoffs_ because energy spent in one area cannot be spent elsewhere
### Some strategies can themselves evolve 
1. some organisms - those that live in specific, static niches - do not need to change much over time in order to survive.
2. other organisms operate in **dynamic niches**  (i.e., niches that change over time), which **requires them to evolve their strategies** in order to survive.
3. Evolving a belief system means changing beliefs, i.e. learning and unlearning concepts.
4. It is difficult to get these changes right.
    1. Failing to change means death because the environment changes in ways that break your strategy
    2. Changing the wrong way means breaking your strategy's alignment with the current environment
5. **Not all strategies are equally capable of evolving, for computational reasons.**
## Hierarchically Composed Strategies Are Better Evolving Themselves 
### A speicfic hierarchical structure improves the evolvability of conceptual networks 
1. with the correct hierarchical structure, one component can be changed, or replaced entirely, with a limited 'blast radius'
    1. A 'parent' concept can remain identical, while the 'child' concept is repalced entirely
    2. This can work safely if the parent-child relationship is context-specific
        1. i.e. the child concept has meaning (i.e. possibly contributes to motion of the body) only in a particular context
    3. This hierarchical configuration also **requires increasing abstraction at higher levels**
        1. The x86 architecture can run anything
        2. An operating system will only run programs fitting a certain format, respecting certain syscalls.
        3. A browser will only run html + javascript + css (i.e. a specific subset of programs)
        4. An opinion javascript web framework will only run spcific kinds of javascript objects
        5. A confirmation diaglog box expects a certain kind of application state to modify
2. Absent the correct hierarchical structure, making discrete changes becomes impossible in large systems
    1. If a change anywhere in a concept network could effect behavior in any context, the risk of changes reducing fitness goes up
    2. One conseuqence of this is that **large systems with incorrectly defined hierarchies become incapable of change**
    3. The only way a large hierachy can continually evolve is if the top layers are extremely lightweight and flexible
        1. Otherwise, changes at the top will break the bottom in many ways, some of which are hard to recognize
3. Organisms that operate in multiple, distinct, changing environments will be selected for this hierarchical structure
    1. This conceptual structure allows for faster learning inindividual environments, thus faster adaptation to change
    2. This conceptual structure allows for generalization across environments, lowering the energy cost of learning
### Memories, beliefs, and abstract concepts exist in a hierarchy of abstraction. 
1. Each layer is a lossy compression of the layer below it
    1. Our senses give us only meaningless impressions
    2. Experiences are compressions of groups of impressions
    3. Memories are compressiosn of groups of experiences
    4. Beliefs are compressions of groups of memories
    5. Concepts are compressions of groups of beliefs
## Belief systems constitute value claims, and cannot be empirically tested unless they are contextually constrained 
## Abstract beliefs as organizing principles are necessary for group survival. 
## Trust in the organizing principle of the group is necessary for group cohesion 
## The evolutionary limit of "trust in the organizing principle" is trusting reality itself. 
## Trusting reality itself motivates faith, hope, and love as instrumental strategies.
