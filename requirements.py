# more stuff to add in:

# turing completenes and its connection to belief in the existence of both future and past
# the idea of karmic loops relating to fourier anaylsis - any signal can be expressed as a sum of harmonics

# 'total acceptance' being a necessity for breaking karmic loops them makes sense, 
# if total acceptance corresponds to 'the topmost abstract node can't be constrained from responding to any signals'
